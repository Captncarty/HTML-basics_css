                <h1>Not just the fastest blockchain</h1>

                <p>Bitcoin SV is the fastest public ledger, with the capability to support over 50,000 transactions 
                    per second. But that's not all. Powered by Bitcoin Scripting, 
                    each transaction can be a smart contract, a crypto-graphically secure token or an NFT. 
                    The possibilities, uses and benefits are truly limitless.</p>
                    
                <p>Bitcoin SV is also a green technology. We focus on CO2 efficiency per transaction 
                    and outclass all competitive blockchains on Coin Carbon Cap since its inception. 
                    Environmentally, Bitcoin SV already directly competes with VISA, the world's most 
                    used payment network yet Bitcoin SV does and enables so much more.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin had many competing development groups over the years that led 
                        to the creation of different protocols that diverged from Satoshi's original ideas. 
                        Bitcoin SV however has distilled Bitcoin back to its purest form, and locked 
                        its protocol in stone, keeping the key economic systems and functionality described 
                        in the Bitcoin white-paper whilst combining it with state-of-the-art technology, 
                        allowing 1000's of Enterprises and Developers to safely build upon it.</p>\

                <p class="comment">Smart contracts allow cryptocurrencies to offer much more than a role 
                    as a digital currency that can transfer funds from point A to point B. 
                    Blockchains with smart contracts can build entire systems of decentralized finance (DeFi) 
                    that can operate on their own without needing a central governing body.</p>
